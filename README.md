# text-classification-models
This project performs two text classification models implemented using Python: a Multinomial Naive Bayes model and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. Both models are designed to classify news articles into various categories. Each model showcases data preprocessing, model training, evaluation metrics, and visualization for performance analysis.
